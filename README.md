# Hunt for the Art!

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the idea that the pandemic has made many of us over reliant on technology. We wanted our project to create interactions between the real world and people and reward them for those interactions. We also wanted to create a project that would encourage physical activity and social interactions

## What it does
Hunt for the Art! is a scavenger hunt with many simple tasks (e.g. do jumping jacks) that a person can perform. You would click on individual squares to reveal a task and press done when you have completed the task. Each time you press done, a piece of the pixel art is revealed, representing the progress youâ€™ve made in the scavenger hunt. When all the tasks are completed, you will be rewarded with a completed pixel art.

## How we built it
We compiled a database of the different simple tasks that we wanted to include. Then we built a backend with python that determines the colour, task, and completion of each pixel square. We then built a website (using Flask) to display all the squares as well as a way to click each square to reveal its task + mark each task as done.

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating a database of tasks that should be included in the scavenger hunt
- Connected the frontend and backend with Flask
- Correctly displaying the completed tasks (User interactions)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- A responsive frontend driven by fast communication between frontend and backend
- Clear and rewarding pixel art

## What we learned
- Learned how to integrate pixel art with complex functions
- Learned how to be creative with existing concepts

## What's next for Hunt for the Art!
- Have cells that aren't square-based (ie. Have trianglar and irregular shapes)
- Allow users to edit/input their own tasks
